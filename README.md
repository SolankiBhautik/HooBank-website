# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

Key Features:

Single-Page Application (SPA): Built with React for seamless navigation without page reloads.
Tailwind CSS for Rapid Styling: Utilizes Tailwind's utility classes for efficient styling and consistent design.
Responsive Design: Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes for optimal viewing.
Figma Design Integration: Showcases the ability to implement designs from Figma into a React project.
Important Notes:

Frontend Only: This project focuses exclusively on the frontend presentation layer. It lacks any backend functionality or data integration.
Limited React Functionality: The React features employed are relatively basic, primarily focusing on component structure, routing, and state management.
Purpose:

Serves as a learning exercise for building single-page applications with React and Tailwind CSS.
Demonstrates the integration of Figma designs into web development workflows.
Provides a foundation for further exploration and experimentation with React concepts.
